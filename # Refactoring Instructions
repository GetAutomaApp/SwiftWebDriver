# Refactoring Instructions

- The majority of this code should be private, only the ChromeDriver & WebDriver methods will be exposed
- Run .swiftlint.yml & lint all the files
- Every time pick all the errors from a single file & try to solve them
- Rerun .swiftlint.yml & ensure those errors are resolved
- After you're done please read this file again & use this as context for the upcoming run
- Don't add any comments to your changes
- Run SwiftBuild to ensure all the code still works + resolve any issues to fix it!
- Re-read this file by sending a âœ… & typing this all out on one line (all the text)
